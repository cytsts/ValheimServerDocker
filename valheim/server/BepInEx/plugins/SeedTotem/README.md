The Seed Totem disperses stored seeds in an area around it.

Place the totem using the Cultivator. It costs:

    5 Fine Wood
    5 Greydwarf Eyes
    1 Surtling Core
    1 Ancient Seed

Use a seed with the item hotkeys to restrict the totem to a single type of seed. It will always make sure that newly placed plants have enough room to grow, but it won't check to make sure that everything around it still has enough room to grow; a totem is not that clever. Limiting it to one type of seed solves this issue.

The green glow fades when the totem runs out of seeds, letting you know to add more.

Also works with trees!

Hold the Use key to add all permitted seeds in Inventory.

Give the totem a whack to harvest all ready plants in the area. (Does not work on trees)

The totem scans the Cultivator, anything that creates a Plant object is considered a "seed".
This means it will include both "Carrot" & "Carrot Seeds" for example.
Notably this does not include the Berry Bushes from Planting Plus. These are Pickable objects instead, they skip the Plant stage, but are permanent, so it should be fine to place them yourself.
