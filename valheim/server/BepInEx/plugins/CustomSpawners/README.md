Custom Spawners

I created this to create dungeons in my server.

All created spawners will appear in the hammer, only admins can build it.

Example config:

It uses a json file to generate spawners.

1.0.5 - Using json to create spawners

1.0.3 - Fixing server sync

1.0.2 - Fixing console error when hammer is equipped.

1.0.1 rrr compatibility

1.0.0 - Release
